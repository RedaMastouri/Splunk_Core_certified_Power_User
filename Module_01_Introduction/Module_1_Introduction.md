## Notes
Regarding the Unit prefixes confusion I recommend reading:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix

"The use of the same unit prefixes with two different meanings has caused confusion. Starting around 1998, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and several other standards and trade organizations addressed the ambiguity by publishing standards and recommendations for a set of binary prefixes that refer exclusively to powers of 1024. Accordingly, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires that SI prefixes only be used in the decimal sense:[1] kilobyte and megabyte denote one thousand bytes and one million bytes respectively (consistent with SI), while new terms such as kibibyte, mebibyte, and gibibyte, having the symbols KiB, MiB, and GiB, denote 1024 bytes, 1048576 bytes, and 1073741824 bytes, respectively.[2] In 2008, the IEC prefixes were incorporated into the International System of Quantities alongside the decimal prefixes of the international standard system of units (see ISO/IEC 80000)."

- M= *1000^2
- Mi = *1024^2
