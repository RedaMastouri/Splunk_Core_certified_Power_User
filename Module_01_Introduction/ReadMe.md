## What is a SIEM?
SIEM stands for security information and event management and provides organizations with next-generation detection, analytics and response.

Security information and event management is a field within the field of computer security, where software products and services combine security information management and security event management. They provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware

## What is Splunk?
- Splunk is a SIEM
- It is a Network Analysis Tool for big data analytics 
- It help to read the raw events and we structure those events to make sense of the data that we're working at

## What does it do?
- 1. 1. Data Analytics: Gives all the metrics for all the things 
- 1. 2. Data Ingest: Data parser, organizer, accepter of all forms of data (Strutured and unstructured)
- 1. 3. Visual display: Create graphs, charts, heat maps, interactive GUI, generate reports, and more.
- 1. 4. Tells the Story: Insight to security intelligence, business operations, identities and assets, etc. 

## How will we be using it?
- 1. 1. Craft searches: Learn how to SPL (Search Processing Language)
> Learn more about SPL in this [link](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/splunk/splunk_search_language.htm)
- 1. 2. Network Traffic Analysis: Review alerts, create signatures, build searches to check for traffic patterns, query for indicators
- 1. 3. Visualize our Data: Build dashboards, create graphs, pie charts, display geographical information, generate reports, timeline analysis

## Notes
Regarding the Unit prefixes confusion I recommend reading:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix

"The use of the same unit prefixes with two different meanings has caused confusion. Starting around 1998, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and several other standards and trade organizations addressed the ambiguity by publishing standards and recommendations for a set of binary prefixes that refer exclusively to powers of 1024. Accordingly, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires that SI prefixes only be used in the decimal sense:[1] kilobyte and megabyte denote one thousand bytes and one million bytes respectively (consistent with SI), while new terms such as kibibyte, mebibyte, and gibibyte, having the symbols KiB, MiB, and GiB, denote 1024 bytes, 1048576 bytes, and 1073741824 bytes, respectively.[2] In 2008, the IEC prefixes were incorporated into the International System of Quantities alongside the decimal prefixes of the international standard system of units (see ISO/IEC 80000)."

- M= *1000^2
- Mi = *1024^2
